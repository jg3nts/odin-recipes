    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch
        loaf pan, preferably glass.
      </li>
      <li>Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.</li>
      <li>Stir bananas, milk, and cinnamon in another bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Beat sugar and butter together in a third bowl with an electric mixer
        until light and fluffy; add eggs one at a time, beating well after each
        addition.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir banana mixture into butter mixture; mix in flour mixture until just
        blended. Fold in chocolate chips; pour batter into the prepared loaf
        pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center
        comes out clean, about 70 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before
        removing to cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.
