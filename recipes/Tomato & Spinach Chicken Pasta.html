      <li>
        Season the chicken as desired. Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over
        medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until well browned, stirring
        often. Remove the chicken from the skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the onion to the skillet and cook until tender-crisp, stirring
        occasionally. Add the wine and heat to a boil, stirring to scrape up any
        browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the tomatoes, Swanson Chicken Broth, penne, and water; heat to a
        boil. Reduce the heat to medium. Cook for 10 minutes or until the penne
        is tender, stirring occasionally. Return the chicken to the skillet.
        Cook for 2 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. Stir in the
        spinach and cook for 1 minute or until the spinach is wilted.
